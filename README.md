# Loan Status Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

The Loan Status Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the status of loan applications. The primary goal is to assist financial institutions in assessing the likelihood of a loan being approved or denied based on historical data and various features associated with loan applications.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and analyze historical loan data to identify patterns and insights that can contribute to the prediction model.

- **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset and transform them to enhance the predictive power of the model.

- **Machine Learning Model:** Implement and train a machine learning model using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, ensemble model (random forest, gradient bossting)  to predict loan status.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This involves systematically searching through a range of hyperparameter values to find the best configuration.

- **Accuracy Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.

- **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface to allow users to input loan application details and receive instant predictions.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly and includes the necessary features for prediction.

2. **Model Training:** Run the provided scripts to train the machine learning model on your dataset.

3. **Prediction:** Utilize the trained model to predict loan status for new loan applications.
